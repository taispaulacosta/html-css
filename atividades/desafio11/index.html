        <h2>Levitating</h2>
        <p>
            If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy<br>
            And I can take you for a ride<br>
            I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm<br>
            Where the music don't stop for life

        <h2>Pretty Please</h2>
        <p>
            Somewhere in the middle<br>
            I think I lied a little<br>
            I, I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change<br>
            But that went out the window, yeah (gonna break, gonna break)
        </p>
        <p>
            I know that I seem a little stressed out<br>
            But you're here now, and you're turning me on<br>
            I wanna feel a different kind of tension<br>
            Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun<br>
            I hate it when you leave me unattended<br>
            'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love<br>
            But my mind is running wild<br>
            Could you help me slow it down?

        <h2>Love Again</h2>
        <p>
            I never thought that I would find a way out<br>
            I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud<br>
            I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore<br>
            But goddamn, you got me in love again<br>
            I used to think that I was made out of stone<br>
            I used to spend so many nights on my own<br>
            I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore<br>
            But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            Show me that heaven's right here, baby<br>
            Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy<br>
            Never have I ever met somebody like you<br>
            Used to be afraid of love and what it might do<br>
            But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
